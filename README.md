# ChaseApp Public Discussion Area

This github is for the community to interact with the ChaseApp development and operations teams

# Bugs and Issue Reporting

Please use the Github Issues tracker to submit public bug reports if you find an issue with the public interfaces (mobile, web), all API issues should be reported internally unless you are unable to do so.

# Ideas for new Features

The Discussions tab is a great place to discuss new ideas, features, or enhancements to existing features in any of the public interfaces.

# Funding

ChaseApp development is funded by running the app itself through our integration with the Nodle SDK. We are built on opensource, have opensourced many of our tools, and we are in the process of opensourcing everything else.

# Community and Governance

ChaseApp is fully supported and funded by the community. When the facilities exist to do so, we will create a DAO and control development and funding through a decentralized, fully democratized system. Stakeholders and the community will drive future direction and allow this project to continue to grow in new ways.
